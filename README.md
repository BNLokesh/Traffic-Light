# Traffic Signal

This project simulates a traffic signal where clicking on the "Stop", "Go", and "Ready" buttons will display the respective colors. It is designed and developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.



## How It Works

The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`styles.css`), and a JavaScript file (`script.js`). Bootstrap is used for styling and layout purposes.

### HTML

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the traffic signal interface. It includes buttons for "Stop", "Go", and "Ready" actions.

### CSS

The `styles.css` file contains the styles for the traffic signal interface, including the colors for the different states of the traffic signal.

### JavaScript

The `script.js` file contains the logic to change the color of the traffic signal based on the button clicked. Event listeners are added to the buttons to trigger the color change.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Click on the "Stop", "Go", or "Ready" buttons to see the corresponding color displayed on the traffic signal.
